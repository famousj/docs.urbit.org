# Unit Tests {#unit-tests}

## Structure {#structure}

The `%base` desk includes a `-test` thread which can run unit tests you've written. A test is a Hoon file which produces a `core`. The `-test` thread will look for any arms in the core whose name begin with `test-`, e.g:

```hoon
|%
++  test-foo
  ...
++  test-bar
  ...
++  test-foo-bar
  ...
--
```

Any arms that don't begin with `test-` will be ignored. Each `test-` arm must produce a `tang` (a `(list tank)`). If the `tang` is empty (`~`), it indicates success. If the `tang` is non-empty, it indicates failure, and the contents of the `tang` is the error message.

To make test-writing easier, the `%base` desk includes the `/lib/test.hoon` library which you can import into your test file. The library contains four functions which all produce `tang`s:

- `expect-eq` - test whether an expression produces the expected value. This function takes `[expected=vase actual=vase]`, comparing `.expected` to `.actual`.
- `expect` - test whether an expression produces `%.y`. This function takes a `vase` containing the result to check.
- `expect-fail` - tests whether the given `trap` crashes, failing if it succeeds.
- `category` - this is a utility that prepends an error message to a failed test (non-null `tang`), passing through an empty `tang` (successful test) unchanged.

The most commonly used function is `expect-eq`, which is used like:

```hoon
++  test-foo
  %+  expect-eq
  !>  'the result I expect'
  !>  (function-i-want-to-test 'some argument')
```

Of course, you'll want to test something else you've written rather than just expressions in the test file itself. To do that, you'd just import the file with `/=` or a similar Ford rune, and then call its functions in the test arms. You're free to do any compositions, import types, etc, as long as the file ultimately produces a `core` with `test-*` arms.

## Running {#running}

The `-test` thread takes a `(list path)` in the Dojo, where each path is a path to a test file. The `path` _must_ include the full path prefix (`/[ship]/[desk]/[case]`). The `path` _may_ omit the mark, since a `.hoon` file is assumed. The `path` _may_ include the name of a test arm after the filename. In that case, only the specified test arm will be run.

The conventional location for tests is a `/tests` directory in the root of a desk.

The output of the `-test` thread will note which arms were tested and whether they succeeded. It will also include:

- The number of micro-seconds it took to execute each test arm.
- A `?` specifying whether all tests succeeded.
- A message confirming the file was built successfully.

Here's an example of running the tests for the `naive.hoon` library:

```
> -test %/tests/lib/naive ~
built   /tests/lib/naive/hoon
>   test-zod-spawn-to-zero: took 81359µs
OK      /lib/naive/test-zod-spawn-to-zero
>   test-zod-spawn-proxy: took 128125µs
OK      /lib/naive/test-zod-spawn-proxy
.............................
....truncated for brevity....
.............................
>   test-approval-for-all: took 647403µs
OK      /lib/naive/test-approval-for-all
>   test-address-padding: took 75104µs
OK      /lib/naive/test-address-padding
ok=%.y
```

Here's an example of running just a single test for `naive.hoon`, the `++test-deposit` arm:

```
> -test %/tests/lib/naive/test-deposit ~
built   /tests/lib/naive/hoon
>   test-deposit: took ms/45.542
OK      /lib/naive/test-deposit
ok=%.y
```

## More info {#more-info}

A good reference example is the test file for the `/lib/number-to-words.hoon` library, located in `/tests/lib/number-to-words.hoon`. Note that the `/tests` directory is not typically included in standard pills. If you want to have a look at existing tests as a reference, you may need to clone the `urbit/urbit` repo on [Github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit).

If you write tests for some of your code, you may wish to exclude the `/tests` directory from the production version of your desk.
