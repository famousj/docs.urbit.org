Gall is one of the nine vanes (kernel modules) of Arvo, Urbit's operating system. Gall's purpose is to manage userspace applications called _agents_. **Agents** are the main kind of userspace application on Urbit. They have a persistent state and API that handles events and produces effects.Gall agents can variously be treated as databases with developer-defined logic, services, daemons, or a kind of state machine.

One or more Gall agents can be put together in a "desk" in Clay (the filesystem vane) and, along with a front-end, can be published and distributed as a cohesive app for users to install.

This section of the docs contains guides related to writing apps and [distributing them](/userspace/apps/guides/software-distribution). It also contains a number of different [examples and exercises](/userspace/apps/examples) you can work through to learn how to build different kinds of apps.

Additionally, the [courses](/courses) section of the docs contain two in-depth app-building tutorials, which are the recommended place to start learning Urbit app development:
