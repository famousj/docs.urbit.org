# Userspace

The userspace docs contain guides, examples, exercises and reference documentation for writing Urbit apps and threads, the latter of which is useful for complex I/O operations.

- [Apps](urbit-docs/userspace/apps) - Guides and resources about writing and publishing Urbit apps.
- [Threads](urbit-docs/userspace/threads) - A thread is a transient process. Threads are primarily used for complex I/O operations.
