Core Academy (CA) prepares developers to become kernel developers.  Although not relying on App Workshop, Core Academy participants should be capable of composing fairly complex applications in Hoon.  C experience is also a prerequisite for the runtime material (Rust for Sword, n√©e Ares).

These notes are from the 2023 cohort of Core Academy.  This course delves into each part of Arvo, Zuse, Hoon, and the runtime to contextualize how Urbit functions and where further development is needed.  The lesson notes thus represent a snapshot of Urbit core development at 412 K and Vere 2.12, and some details may have changed since that release.

Preliminary material:

- [Hoon School, Text Parsing III](/courses/hoon-school/Q2-parsing)
- [Hoon School, Generic and Variant Cores](/courses/hoon-school/R-metals)
- [The Nested Cores Pattern](https://developers.urbit.org/blog/nested-core-pattern) (archive link)
