## FAQ

{% faqSection question="How do I write a proposal?" %}
Proposals should clearly articulate your idea and the value it
will bring to the Urbit network.

Good proposals all include the following:


— A detailed and clear description of the proposal. If you're
proposing something technical, user stories are a good idea.

— An overview of why you are the right person for the job. A
description of your background, familiarity with the project, and
professional/education experience are all good starts.

— Your estimate for date of completion.

— The amount of funding you'd like for the project, denominated in
stars. What specific deliverables will look like.


It’s recommended to break your project into milestones, each of
which must have its own completion dates, funding amounts and
deliverables. In general, proposals should target a first
deliverable within two months of the start of the project.
Proposals should have a maximum of five milestones as scoping a
project beyond that is impractical, and each milestone should
constitute significant enough work to warrant the reward of a full
star.
