# Operator's Manual

Welcome to the Operator's Manual. These docs contain guides and reference material for users. If you're new to Urbit, the [Getting Started](urbit-docs/manual/getting-started) section is the place to go.

- [Getting Started](urbit-docs/manual/getting-started) - This section will help you obtain an Urbit ID, find a hosting provider, learn how to self-host, and other things to get you up and running.

## Other Sections
- [Urbit OS](urbit-docs/manual/os) - This section describes how to interact with your running Urbit ship. This includes working with the filesystem, command line (Dojo), resolving common issues, and more.
- [Urbit ID](urbit-docs/manual/id) - Urbit ID is our public-key infrastructure, which is what allows you to truly own your identity. Here you'll find guides for interacting with your Urbit ID via our Bridge application.
- [Running Urbit](urbit-docs/manual/running) - This section contains information about running Urbit and related services in the cloud, as well as reference information for the runtime.
