# System

This section of the docs contains guides and reference material for the three basic components of the system: the Arvo kernel, the Vere runtime and Azimuth, the PKI and identity system on the Ethereum blockchain.

While most of the app-related documentation is in the [Userspace](urbit-docs/userspace) section, the [Kernel](urbit-docs/system/kernel) documentation is a useful reference when interacting with Vanes from apps.

- [Kernel](urbit-docs/system/kernel) - Guides and reference material about Urbit's kernel Arvo, and its kernel modules called Vanes.
- [Runtime](urbit-docs/system/runtime) - Urbit's runtime is called Vere. It interprets compiled Nock, handles I/O, and manages state checkpoints and the event log.
- [Identity](urbit-docs/system/identity) - Urbit's indentity system and public-key infrastructure is called Azimuth, and lives on the Ethereum blockchain.
