# Document Proposal

A **document proposal** is a type of [vote](voting.md) action taken by the [Galactic Senate](senate.md) over [Azimuth](azimuth.md). By passing a document proposal, [Galaxies](galaxy.md) in the Senate agree to legitimize a document with arbitrary content. Such a document might make claims about the state of the world; an example document that would be subject to this type of vote might be a file that says, "@urbit_senate is the official Twitter account of the senate, and is to be managed by John Doe until further notice."
