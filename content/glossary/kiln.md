# Kiln

The [hood](urbit-docs/glossary/hood) [agent](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) is divided into three separate sub-apps: `%drum`, `%kiln` and `%helm`. **Kiln** is the part that handles [desk](urbit-docs/glossary/desk) installation and updates, and the running of the [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) they contain.
