# Wrapper

A **wrapper** is a library that takes a [Gall](urbit-docs/glossary/gall) [agent](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) [core](urbit-docs/glossary/core) as its argument, augmenting the functionality of the agent. The most common agent wrapper is the `dbug` library, which adds debugging functionality to an agent.
