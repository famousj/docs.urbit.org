# Ames

**Ames** is the name of the Urbit network and the [vane](urbit-docs/glossary/vane) that communicates over it. It's an encrypted peer-to-peer network composed of instances of the [Arvo](urbit-docs/glossary/arvo) operating system. Each point ([galaxy](urbit-docs/glossary/galaxy), [star](urbit-docs/glossary/star), [planet](urbit-docs/glossary/planet), [moon](urbit-docs/glossary/moon), or [comet](urbit-docs/glossary/comet)) communicates over the network utilizing the Ames protocol.
