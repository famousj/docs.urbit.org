# Card

A **card** is the data type for effects produced by
[Gall](urbit-docs/glossary/gall) [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) and
[threads](urbit-docs/glossary/thread). It may contain things like requests to
[vanes](urbit-docs/glossary/vane) (kernel modules),
[pokes](urbit-docs/glossary/poke) to other agents,
[facts](urbit-docs/glossary/fact) for subscribers, etc.
