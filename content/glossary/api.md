# API

**API** stands for "application programming interface". It refers to the definitions and protocols that allow one application to communicate with another. In Urbit, some notable APIs are the `task`s and `gift`s of [vanes](urbit-docs/glossary/vane) (kernel modules) and things like [pokes](urbit-docs/glossary/poke) for [Gall](urbit-docs/glossary/gall) [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent).
