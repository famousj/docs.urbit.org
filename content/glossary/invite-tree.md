# Invite Tree

The **Invite Tree** is the state stored by the [Delegated Sending](urbit-docs/glossary/delegated-sending) contract on [Azimuth](urbit-docs/glossary/azimuth), and is a record of who gave a [planet](urbit-docs/glossary/planet) to whom. This allows for community applications, such as a chat channel for all distantly related planets.
