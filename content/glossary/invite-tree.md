# Invite Tree {#invite-tree}

The **Invite Tree** is the state stored by the [Delegated Sending](delegated-sending.md) contract on [Azimuth](azimuth.md), and is a record of who gave a [planet](planet.md) to whom. This allows for community applications, such as a chat channel for all distantly related planets.
