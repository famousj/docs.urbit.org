# Aural ASCII

The [Hoon](hoon.md) language makes extensive use of non-alphanumeric symbols, most notably in composing [runes](rune.md). When discussing Hoon code aloud, it is cumbersome to say, for example, "exclamation mark left-angle bracket" in reference to the `!<` rune. To make it easier, a set of pronounceable monosyllabic names for ASCII special symbols are conventionally used. In the `!<` example, this would be called "zapgal", where `!` is "zap" and `<` is "gal".

Here is a complete list of pronunciations:

| Symbol      | Name |
|-------------|------|
| `␣` (space) | ace  |
| `\`         | bas  |
| `$`         | buc  |
| `_`         | cab  |
| `%`         | cen  |
| `:`         | col  |
| `,`         | com  |
| `"`         | doq  |
| `.`         | dot  |
| `/`         | fas  |
| `<`         | gal  |
| `␣␣`, `\0a`  | gap  |
| `>`         | gar  |
| `#`         | hax  |
| `-`         | hep  |
| `{`         | kel  |
| `}`         | ker  |
| `^`         | ket  |
| `+`         | lus  |
| `;`         | mic  |
| `(`         | pal  |
| `&`         | pam  |
| `)`         | par  |
| `@`         | pat  |
| `[`         | sel  |
| `]`         | ser  |
| `~`         | sig  |
| `'`         | soq  |
| `*`         | tar  |
| `` ` ``     | tic  |
| `=`         | tis  |
| `?`         | wut  |
| `!`         | zap  |
