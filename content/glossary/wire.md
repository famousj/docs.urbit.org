# Wire

A **wire** is a tag specified for responses to requests a [Gall](urbit-docs/glossary/gall) [agent](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) makes to other agents or [vanes](urbit-docs/glossary/vane). The type of a wire is the same as a [path](urbit-docs/glossary/path), having the format `/foo/bar/baz`. The wire lets an agent know what a particular message relates to. The content of the wire is up to the developer, depending on the needs and logic of their agent.
