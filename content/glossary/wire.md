# Wire

A **wire** is a tag specified for responses to requests a [Gall](gall.md) [agent](agent.md) makes to other agents or [vanes](vane.md). The type of a wire is the same as a [path](path.md), having the format `/foo/bar/baz`. The wire lets an agent know what a particular message relates to. The content of the wire is up to the developer, depending on the needs and logic of their agent.
