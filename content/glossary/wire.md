# Wire

A **wire** is a tag specified for responses to requests a [Gall](/glossary/gall) [agent](/glossary/agent) makes to other agents or [vanes](/glossary/vane). The type of a wire is the same as a [path](/glossary/path), having the format `/foo/bar/baz`. The wire lets an agent know what a particular message relates to. The content of the wire is up to the developer, depending on the needs and logic of their agent.
