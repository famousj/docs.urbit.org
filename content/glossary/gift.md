# Gift

A `%gift` [card](urbit-docs/glossary/card) is an effect produced by [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) and [threads](urbit-docs/glossary/thread). It is a *response* to a request from another agent or [vane](urbit-docs/glossary/vane), as opposed to a `%pass` card, which is a *request*. The main kind of gift is a [fact](urbit-docs/glossary/fact), which is an update given to subscribers.
