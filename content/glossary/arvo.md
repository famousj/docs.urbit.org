# Arvo

**Arvo** is the Urbit operating system and kernel. Arvo's state is a pure function of its [event log](glossary/eventlog), and it serves as the Urbit event manager. It contains [vanes](glossary/vane), which are kernel modules that perform essential system operations.

Arvo being purely functional means that the state of the operating system at a given moment is completely determined by the sequence of events in the event log. In other words, the state of an Arvo instance is given by a lifecycle function

```
L: History âžœ State
```

where `History` consists of the set of all possible sequences of events in an Arvo event log.

Arvo coordinates and reloads vanes. It can be thought of as a traffic-director. Any vane needs to go through Arvo before reaching another vane. Events and their effects happen like so:

```
Unix event -> Vere -> Arvo -> vane -> Arvo
```

Here, [Vere](glossary/vere) is the virtual machine running Urbit.

Arvo is located in `/base/sys/arvo.hoon` within your urbit.

Arvo vanes are [Ames](glossary/ames) for networking, [Behn](glossary/behn) for timing, [Clay](glossary/clay) for the filesystem and build system, [Dill](glossary/dill) for terminal driving, [Eyre](glossary/eyre) for the web server, [Gall](glossary/gall) for application management, [Iris](glossary/iris) for the HTTP client, [Jael](glossary/jael) for PKI management, and [Khan](glossary/khan) for external control and thread running. [Lick](glossary/lick) for external communication.

Vanes and other programs for Arvo are written in [Hoon](glossary/hoon).

A ship creates its own copy of Arvo via a bootstrap sequence known as a [Pill](glossary/pill).
