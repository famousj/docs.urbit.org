**Lick** is the interprocess communication (IPC) [vane](/glossary/vane) (kernel module). It allows for applications to open and close IPC ports to earth. For example, a [Gall](/glossary/gall) agent can send a `%spin` card to open an IPC port and allow for an earth process to communicate with it through `%spit` and `%soak` cards. 

Lick is located in `/base/sys/vane/lick.hoon` within [Arvo](/glossary/arvo).
