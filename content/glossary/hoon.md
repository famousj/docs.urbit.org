# Hoon

Hoon is a strict, higher-order typed functional programming language that compiles itself to [Nock](urbit-docs/glossary/nock). As a result Hoon code is effectively implemented by the interpreter [Vere](urbit-docs/glossary/vere). Programs for the Urbit operating system and kernel, [Arvo](urbit-docs/glossary/arvo), are written in Hoon.

The Hoon standard library and compiler is located in `/base/sys/hoon.hoon` within your urbit.
