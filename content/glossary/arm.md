# Arm

An **arm** is a named Hoon expression in a [core](urbit-docs/glossary/core). A core contains one or more arms. If a core is thought of as an object in an object-oriented language, its arms can be thought of as its methods.

Arms are one of the two types of [wing](urbit-docs/glossary/wing) in the [subject](urbit-docs/glossary/subject), the other being a [leg](urbit-docs/glossary/leg).
