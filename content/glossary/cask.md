# Cask

A **cask** is a [cell](urbit-docs/glossary/cell) whose head is a [mark](urbit-docs/glossary/mark) and whose tail is a [noun](urbit-docs/glossary/noun). It is similar to a `cage` except with a simple noun rather than `vase` in the tail. Casks are primarily used by the [kernel](urbit-docs/glossary/kernel) for sending data over the [Ames](urbit-docs/glossary/ames) network, because `vase`s should only be used locally.
