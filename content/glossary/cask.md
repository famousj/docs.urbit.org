# Cask {#cask}

A **cask** is a [cell](cell.md) whose head is a [mark](mark.md) and whose tail is a [noun](noun.md). It is similar to a `cage` except with a simple noun rather than `vase` in the tail. Casks are primarily used by the [kernel](kernel.md) for sending data over the [Ames](ames.md) network, because `vase`s should only be used locally.
