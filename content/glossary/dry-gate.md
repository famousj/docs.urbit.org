A **dry gate** is a [gate](/glossary/gate) that only accepts an argument of the type it explicitly specified. This is in contrast to a [wet gate](/glossary/wet-gate), which can accept arguments of different types and transparently pass them through. The typical [rune](/glossary/rune) for a dry gate is `|=`.
