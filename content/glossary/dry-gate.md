# Dry Gate

A **dry gate** is a [gate](urbit-docs/glossary/gate) that only accepts an argument of the type it explicitly specified. This is in contrast to a [wet gate](urbit-docs/glossary/wet-gate), which can accept arguments of different types and transparently pass them through. The typical [rune](urbit-docs/glossary/rune) for a dry gate is `|=`.
