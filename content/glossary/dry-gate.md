# Dry Gate {#dry-gate}

A **dry gate** is a [gate](gate.md) that only accepts an argument of the type it explicitly specified. This is in contrast to a [wet gate](wet-gate.md), which can accept arguments of different types and transparently pass them through. The typical [rune](rune.md) for a dry gate is `|=`.
