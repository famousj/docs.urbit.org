# Galaxy

A **galaxy** can be one of two related things:

- A kind of [Azimuth](/glossary/azimuth) Urbit identity that sits at the top of the identity hierarchy. Galaxies, in this sense, have the power to issue [stars](/glossary/star), meaning that all other kinds of identities ultimate derive from galaxies. Galaxies also form a [Senate](/glossary/senate), the governing body of Azimuth. The Senate has the power to update the logic of Azimuth by [majority vote](/glossary/voting).

- A [ship](/glossary/ship) on the Arvo network whose identity is a galaxy in the former definition. In this sense, galaxies act as infrastructure for the [Arvo](/glossary/arvo) network, providing [Ames](/glossary/ames)-related services, such as peer-to-peer routing and distributing [over-the-air software updates](/glossary/ota-updates). Stars rely on galaxies for these services in the way that planets rely on stars.

Galaxies are 8-bit, representable by numbers 0 to 255. This means that there are 256 possible galaxies; each of these galaxies is able to issue 255 [stars](/glossary/star). Galaxies have one-syllable names like `~mul` or `~lux`.
