# Censures

The **Censures** [Azimuth](azimuth.md) contract allows [stars](star.md) and [galaxies](galaxy.md) to assign negative reputation information to other points of equal or lower rank. This information is publicly visible and is intended to create an economic deterrent to bad behavior.

Positive reputation information cannot be similarly assigned to Urbit identities but it may be inferred from a lack of censures.
