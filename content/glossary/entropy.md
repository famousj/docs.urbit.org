# Entropy

**Entropy** is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in cryptography or other uses that require random data. In Urbit's case, entropy is provided to [Arvo](/glossary/arvo) by the runtime [Vere](/glossary/vere). The entropy is made available to [agents](/glossary/agent) and [threads](/glossary/thread) as the `eny` value in the [bowl](/glossary/bowl). It's also available as `eny` in the [dojo](/glossary/dojo) and `%say`/`%ask` [generators](/glossary/generator).
