# Cold atom

A **cold atom** is an [atom](urbit-docs/glossary/atom) whose type is an exact value equal to itself. This in contrast to a [warm atom](urbit-docs/glossary/warm-atom), whose type is a general [aura](urbit-docs/glossary/aura). Cold atoms have a `%` prefix, for example `%foo`, `%123`, `%0xdead.beef`, etc.
