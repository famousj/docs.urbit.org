# ~zod

There are 256 [galaxies](urbit-docs/glossary/galaxy), and `~zod` is the first: number `0`. This galaxy is usually the first place core system updates are published. Other galaxies then sync from `~zod` and distribute the update to their children. A fake `~zod` is also conventionally used for testing by developers.
