# Ship

A **ship** is an instance of an Urbit computer that is a peer on the [Arvo](arvo) network.

A ship can be one of five classes:

- [comets](comet), disposable identities.
- [moons](moon), connected devices subordinated to a ship.
- [planets](planet), individual users.
- [stars](star), network infrastructure nodes.
- [galaxy](galaxy), also network infrastructure nodes.

To be able to use the Arvo network, planets, stars, and galaxies must be combined with an [Azimuth](azimuth)-based Urbit identity in the form of a [keyfile](keyfile).
