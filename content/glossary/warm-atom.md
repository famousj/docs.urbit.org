# Warm atom

A **warm atom** is an [atom](urbit-docs/glossary/atom) with an ordinary [aura](urbit-docs/glossary/aura). The type of a warm atom is, conceptually, the set of all possible values for that aura. For example, the [cord](urbit-docs/glossary/cord) `'foo'` nests under the type of the cord `'bar'` - they both have `@t` auras. This is in contrast to a [cold atom](urbit-docs/glossary/cold-atom), where its type is an exact value.
