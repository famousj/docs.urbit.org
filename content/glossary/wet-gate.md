# Wet Gate

A **wet gate** is a [gate](urbit-docs/glossary/gate) that can accept arguments of a type other than what it has specified, and transparently pass them through. This is in contrast to a [dry gate](urbit-docs/glossary/dry-gate), which can only take arguments of the type it specified. The typical [rune](urbit-docs/glossary/rune) for a wet gate is `|*`, as opposed to the usual `|=`.
