**Userspace** is composed of [Gall](/glossary/gall) [agents](/glossary/agent), [threads](/glossary/thread), [generators](/glossary/generator), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](/glossary/clay). This is in contrast to [kernelspace](/glossary/kernel), which is composed of [Arvo](/glossary/arvo), its [vanes](/glossary/vane) (kernel modules), and associated libraries.
