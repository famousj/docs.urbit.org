# Userspace

**Userspace** is composed of [Gall](urbit-docs/glossary/gall) [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent), [threads](urbit-docs/glossary/thread), [generators](urbit-docs/glossary/generator), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](urbit-docs/glossary/clay). This is in contrast to [kernelspace](urbit-docs/glossary/kernel), which is composed of [Arvo](urbit-docs/glossary/arvo), its [vanes](urbit-docs/glossary/vane) (kernel modules), and associated libraries.
