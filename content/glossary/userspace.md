# Userspace {#userspace}

**Userspace** is composed of [Gall](gall.md) [agents](agent.md), [threads](thread.md), [generators](generator.md), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](clay.md). This is in contrast to [kernelspace](kernel.md), which is composed of [Arvo](arvo.md), its [vanes](vane.md) (kernel modules), and associated libraries.
