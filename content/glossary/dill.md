**Dill** is the terminal-driver [vane](/glossary/vane). You run your urbit in your Unix terminal, and Unix sends every event—such as a keystroke or a change in the dimensions of the terminal window—to be handled by Dill.

A keyboard event's journey from Unix to Dojo, the Urbit shell, can be imagined as diagrammed below:

```
Keystroke in Unix -> Vere (virtual machine) -> Arvo -> Dill -> the Dojo
```

Dill is located at `/base/sys/vane/dill.hoon` within [Arvo](/glossary/arvo).
