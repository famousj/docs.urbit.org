# Kernel

The **kernel** is the core, fundamental components of an operating system. In the case of [Arvo](urbit-docs/glossary/arvo), it is `arvo.hoon`, its [vanes](urbit-docs/glossary/vane) (kernel modules), and associated libraries. The code for Arvo's kernel is located in the `/sys` directory of the `%base` [desk](urbit-docs/glossary/desk). "Kernelspace" is contrasted with "userspace", which includes [agents](urbit-docs/glossary/agent), [threads](urbit-docs/glossary/thread), [generators](urbit-docs/glossary/generator), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](urbit-docs/glossary/clay).
