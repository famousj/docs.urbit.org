# Kernel

The **kernel** is the core, fundamental components of an operating system. In the case of [Arvo](/glossary/arvo), it is `arvo.hoon`, its [vanes](/glossary/vane) (kernel modules), and associated libraries. The code for Arvo's kernel is located in the `/sys` directory of the `%base` [desk](/glossary/desk). "Kernelspace" is contrasted with "userspace", which includes [agents](/glossary/agent), [threads](/glossary/thread), [generators](/glossary/generator), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](/glossary/clay).
