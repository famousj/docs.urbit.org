# Dojo

The **Dojo** is Urbit's command-line application that processes system commands and returns output. It also runs [Hoon](hoon) and [Nock](nock) code, making it a good place to play around with those languages.

The Dojo is the first thing you encounter after successfully booting your [ship](ship).
