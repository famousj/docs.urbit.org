# Dojo

The **Dojo** is Urbit's command-line application that processes system commands and returns output. It also runs [Hoon](/glossary/hoon) and [Nock](/glossary/nock) code, making it a good place to play around with those languages.

The Dojo is the first thing you encounter after successfully booting your [ship](/glossary/ship).
