# Senate

The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](urbit-docs/glossary/galaxy) that governs [Azimuth](urbit-docs/glossary/azimuth) by [majority vote](urbit-docs/glossary/voting). There are two types of votes: an [upgrade proposal](urbit-docs/glossary/upgrade), which is a motion to update the logic of Azimuth (i.e. [Ecliptic](urbit-docs/glossary/ecliptic)), and a [document proposal](urbit-docs/glossary/docvote), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an arbitrary document.
