# Senate {#senate}

The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](galaxy.md) that governs [Azimuth](azimuth.md) by [majority vote](voting.md). There are two types of votes: an [upgrade proposal](upgrade.md), which is a motion to update the logic of Azimuth (i.e. [Ecliptic](ecliptic.md)), and a [document proposal](docvote.md), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an arbitrary document.
