The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](/glossary/galaxy) that governs [Azimuth](/glossary/azimuth) by [majority vote](/glossary/voting). There are two types of votes: an [upgrade proposal](/glossary/upgrade), which is a motion to update the logic of Azimuth (i.e. [Ecliptic](/glossary/ecliptic)), and a [document proposal](/glossary/docvote), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an arbitrary document.
