# Cell

A **cell** is an ordered pair of [nouns](/glossary/noun). It is a fundamental data type in both [Hoon](/glossary/hoon) and [Nock](/glossary/cell): a noun is either an [atom](/glossary/atom) or a cell. Its [mold](/glossary/mold) in Hoon is `^`, and it's formed with either square brackets like `[123 456]` or `:`-family [runes](/glossary/rune). A cell can also be thought of as an internal node in the binary tree of a noun. It is similar to a cons-cell in Lisp.
