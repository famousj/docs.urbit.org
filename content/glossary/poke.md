# Poke

A **poke** is a kind of `note` passed from one [agent](/glossary/agent) to another in a [card](/glossary/card). A poke is a one-off request/action, as opposed to an ongoing subscription. A poke may contain any kind of data, and may go over the network to remote ships. A poke is handled by the `++on-poke` [arm](/glossary/arm) of an agent.
