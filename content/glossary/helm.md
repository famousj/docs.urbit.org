# Helm

The [hood](/glossary/hood) [agent](/glossary/agent) is divided into three separate sub-apps: `%drum`, `%kiln` and `%helm`. **Helm** provides an interface to various system settings, functions and reports. Helm can give memory reports, control kernel message verbosity, ping other ships, manage [moons](/glossary/moon), etc. Most of these functions are exposed in the [dojo](/glossary/dojo) with Hood [generators](/glossary/generator) (`|mass`, `|verb`, `|hi`, `|moon`, etc).
