# Helm {#helm}

The [hood](hood.md) [agent](agent.md) is divided into three separate sub-apps: `%drum`, `%kiln` and `%helm`. **Helm** provides an interface to various system settings, functions and reports. Helm can give memory reports, control kernel message verbosity, ping other ships, manage [moons](moon.md), etc. Most of these functions are exposed in the [dojo](dojo.md) with Hood [generators](generator.md) (`|mass`, `|verb`, `|hi`, `|moon`, etc).
