# Roller

A **roller** is a service that can be run on a [ship](/glossary/ship) that accepts [L2](/glossary/rollups) [Azimuth](/glossary/azimuth) transactions, bundles them together, and submits the batch to Azimuth on the Ethereum blockchain. Tlon runs the roller used by the default [Bridge](/glossary/bridge) instance at [bridge.urbit.org](https://bridge.urbit.org), but anyone can run their own - especially if they want to submit large volumes of transactions.
