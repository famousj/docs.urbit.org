# Glob

A **glob** is a bundle of front-end resources for an app which is served to a web client by the `%docket` [agent](urbit-docs/glossary/agent) in the [%landscape](urbit-docs/glossary/landscape) [desk](urbit-docs/glossary/desk). The glob will typically contain an `index.html` file, along with CSS, JS, and other resources the web app needs. The glob for an app will be retrieved when you install it, either over [Ames](urbit-docs/glossary/ames) or from an external web server.
