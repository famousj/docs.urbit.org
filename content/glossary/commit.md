# Commit

[Clay](urbit-docs/glossary/clay) is [Arvo's](urbit-docs/glossary/arvo) revision-controlled filesystem, and a **commit** is a particular change/revision. [Desks](urbit-docs/glossary/desk) may be mounted to the host (Unix/Windows) filesystem, their files edited, and the resulting changes committed with the `|commit` generator in the [dojo](urbit-docs/glossary/dojo).
