# Commit {#commit}

[Clay](clay.md) is [Arvo's](arvo.md) revision-controlled filesystem, and a **commit** is a particular change/revision. [Desks](desk.md) may be mounted to the host (Unix/Windows) filesystem, their files edited, and the resulting changes committed with the `|commit` generator in the [dojo](dojo.md).
